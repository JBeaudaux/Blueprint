                <h1><font color="#0099FF"><i>Blue print</i></font>, in a few words</h1>
                <p align="justify"> Health is our most precious gift, but also the most fragile one. Indeed, noone is safe from the sudden deterioration of its health condition. For instance, heart diseases (e.g. strokes, ischaemic heart diseases) may impact anyone and cause about 25% of total death, and many elders have experienced critical situations (e.g. falls, loss of points of reference) without being able to call for help. Such events are difficult to anticipate long in advance through regular medical check-ups, and may lead to severe and irreversible consequences in ones health.</p>
		
		<p align="justify">Yet, simple little steps can be followed to take back your life in hand and prevent most potential at-risk events. The non-obtrusive monitoring of a few health parameters (e.g. heart rate and variation, movement) or the follow-up of life-style and daily activity can be sufficient to anticipate and address in time most of the aforementioned critical situations. In this context, the <font color="#0099FF"><i>Blue print</i></font> project aims at helping you take your health in hand and reduce your risk level, step by step, by offering open, efficient and non-obtrusive solutions to monitor, process and analyse key health parameters. </p>

		<h3>Who is <font color="#0099FF"><i>Blue print</i></font> for?</h3>

<!-- We all have relatives, of all ages and condition, that have been affected by sudden crisis in their health. To name a few situations, about XX persons are subject to heart attack every day in the world, and XX elder and disabled people fall at home without the possibility to get direct assistance. Such events can hit anyone, at diverse degree. They are particularly difficult to anticipate long in advance, even by during regular medical check-up, and may lead to severe and irreversible consequences in ones health.</p>
		<p align="justify">Yet, through the evaluation of a few simple health parameters (e.g. hearth rate and variance, position and orientation) and optionally by answering basic questions (e.g. on diet, physical activity), most of the aforementioned dangerous situations could be anticipated and addressed in time, either through a change in behavior (e.g. resting for a few minutes) or by efficiently notifying relatives or the appropriate service. In this context, the <font color="#0099FF"><i>Blue print</i></font> project has been launched to help you take your health in hand and reduce your risk, step by step.</p>-->

                <h2>In a heartbeat...</h2>
                <p align="justify">Our lifestyle and environmental parameters have a direct impact on our health and, above all, our heart condition. Eating habits, physical activity and ambient temperature are a few everyday-life factors that induce a change in our heart beat level and variability. Thus, in this context, it is possible to follow the evolution of your heart beats and anticipate potential strokes, advising you to rest at a point when it may save your life.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0099FF"><i>Blue print</i></font> provides comprehensive and integrated solutions to help you follow your heart health up and evaluates strokes risk in real-time. To do so, it adds throrough analysis of health key factors to everyday-life equipments such as watches and smartphones. This way, <font color="#0099FF"><i>Blue print</i></font> provides you with all the tools needed to take your health back in hand, in a heartbeat.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-270 fl push-left-60">
                <h2>Step by step...</h2>
                <p align="justify">Weight, respiratory ease and heart condition are just a few factors relying on modifyable lifestyle and daily habits. Improving your health thus comes through eating well, but also adapting your physical activity to meet your needs. Yet, empirically finding your own best-suited pace is often difficult, discouraging and takes time.</p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0099FF"><i>Blue print</i></font> ambitions to give you the ability to apprehend the influence of little actions on your health, and find your own ideal life configuration. A few more steps a day, taking the stairs, having long enough sleep and rest periods, all these apparently insignificant actions combined can make you improve your body condition. <font color="#0099FF"><i>Blue print</i></font> allows you to monitor their joint impact and evolution on the long run, and change your habits at your own rythm, step by step.</p>

                <h2>On your feet...</h2>
                <p align="justify">Among older adults, falls are the leading cause of both fatal and nonfatal injuries. Indeed, one out of three of them were confronted to this problem at least once in its life, and in some case, they may find themselves unable to get back on their feet and call for help. In parallel to potential injuries, many people who fall develop a fear of falling, that often makes them limit their activities, mobility and social interactions.</p>

		<p align="justify">Although falls are unpredictible and can hardly be avoided, their detection can allow for care services to intervene swiftly and in time thus limitating injuries. <font color="#0099FF"><i>Blue print</i></font> offers non-obtrusive solutions for automated fall-detection, ultimately leading to reduced risk of injuries and improved confidence.</p>
